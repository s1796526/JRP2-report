# JRP2_report_s1796526_JPBenhaiem
All MATLAB CODE for the JRP2 report written by Jonathan Benhaiem (s1796526)

Example files contain raw and pre-processed files (time series eeg data from 32channel)
Channel locations encoded in: 'chanlocnew.ced' and also accessible in 'chanlocnew.txt' for easier import in matlab

%% PreProcessingPipeline.m is a script that functions as a feedthrough of files to pre-process all files. 
%% cleanICA2.m  is a script to run a second ICA on the pre-processed data to determine the amo

%% powerSpectralDensity.m is a script to compute pWelch based power spectrum density, absolute power and relative power.

%% functionalConnectivity.m is a script to compute PLV and PLI functional connectivity measures in a pipeline, and plotting the graphs.
